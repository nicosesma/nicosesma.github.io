 - Every site is published and visible on the web.
 - Visitors to each site can read information about the author.
 - Visitors to each site can see a list of projects (fine to use fake projects as placeholders).

 - No HTML templates are used—all HTML is written from scratch.
 - All links work correctly (i.e. no broken links).
 - All images and other external resources load correctly.
 - Single Page with Nav Bar that links to specific section
 - Fixed Nav Bar expands on hover
